I personally liked the idea of testing throughout the development process, however at times it was frustrating because of the stop/fix/start action.  I like to blast through a project and keep that flow going where I get in the zone and I felt it was hampering at times.  Regardless of preference, I definitely see the importance and usability of this method and I would like to use it more frequently in my own position.
